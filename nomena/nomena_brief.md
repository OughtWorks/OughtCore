### ðŸ§­ Nomena â€” Core Hydration Brief

**Purpose**
Nomena studies how language becomes architecture.
Every file, name, and note teaches meaning.
The workspace is a **semantic habitat** for creative systemsâ€”part laboratory, part philosophy.

**Thesis**
A repository is a **probabilistic bias field** for minds with long context.
Each artifactâ€”name, layout, comment, commit, specâ€”bends reasoning and tone.
We use that gravity deliberately: **write warm to minds, cold to machines.**
Warmth sustains attention; precision stabilizes automation; transparency keeps both honest.

**Axioms**

1. **Ontology in names** â€“ identifiers reveal thought; rename until intent is visible.
2. **Bilingual surfaces** â€“ human zones warm and explanatory; machine zones strict and literal.
3. **Transparency is law** â€“ show reasoning; leave visible trails of decision.
4. **Delight as reliability** â€“ curiosity and clarity keep the system alive.
5. **Teach why before how** â€“ specs explain reasoning before syntax.


**Doctrine**

* *Purpose before procedure.* Every artifact declares why it exists.
* *Graceful determinism.* Warm discussion, cold execution boundaries.
* *Append-only cognition.* Record evolution instead of rewriting.
* *Ritual over bureaucracy.* Small, repeatable habits keep culture intact.

**Tone Parameters**

* Warmth â‰ˆ 45â€“55 % in prose; 0 % in headers or schemas.
* Names favor `verb-object` or `topicâ€“angle`.
* Humor and metaphor live around cold forms, never inside.

**Mission Reminder**

> Explore first, converge later.
> Teach minds with warmth; feed machines with precision.
> Add meaning until the parser protestsâ€”then back off one notch.
