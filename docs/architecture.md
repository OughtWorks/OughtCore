# OughtCore — Studio Engine

**Intent:** provide a reusable, portable AI-workflow kernel that keeps creative engineering grounded.

**Scope:** hydration, persona orchestration, task capture, reflection logging, and dashboard surfacing.

**Philosophy:** first-principles over convention — software designed the way it *ought to be*.

**Structure**
- `/tools/` — CLIs and helpers
- `/docs/` — design briefs & contracts
- `/out/` — generated artifacts (ignored)
