# OughtCore

OughtCore is the internal engine of OughtWorks Studios — the reusable AI workflow that powers everything the studio builds.
It’s engineered to turn reflective design principles into reliable automation: hydration, persona orchestration, task capture, and self-auditing dashboards that keep projects coherent.

Built on first-principles engineering rather than convention, OughtCore helps humans and AI collaborate the way they ought to — with clarity, traceability, and speed.

> *Software designed the way it ought to be.*
